HomeKit support for ESPHome-based ESP32 devices

## 1. Introduction

This project aims to bring HomeKit support to ESP32 devices flashed with an ESPHome configuration that will enable you to directly control the device from the Apple Home app without anything else inbetween.

Components can be imported like any other external compoents as follows:

```yaml
external_components:
  source: github://rednblkx/HAP-ESPHome@main
  refresh: 0s
```

See [Components](#3-components) for documentation.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Some components like Bluetooth for example, take up a lot of space in RAM and will result in error during compiling, something like `section '.iram0.text' will not fit in region 'iram0_0_seg'` will be present in the log.

### Supported entity types

| Type   | Attributes                                                            | Notes                                                                                                                                               |
|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Light  | On/Off, Brightness, RGB, Color Temperature                            |                                                                                                                                                     |
| Lock   | Lock/Unlock                                                           | Homekey can be enabled but only the `pn532_spi` or the `pn532_uart` components are supported to be used with it                                  |
| Switch | On/Off                                                                |                                                                                                                                                     |
| Sensor | Temperature, Humidity, Illuminance, Air Quality, CO2, CO, PM10, PM2.5 | `device_class` property has to be declared with the sensor type as per HASS [docs](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/sensor/#device-class) |
| Fan    | On/Off                                                                |                                                                                                                                                     |

## 2. Prerequisites

The components were designed to be used with ESP-IDF version 5.

See below required configuration that needs to be present in your yaml file.

```yaml
esp32:
  board: <insert board id>
  framework:
    type: esp-idf
    version: 5.5.0
    platform_version: 55.03.30-2
    sdkconfig_options:
      CONFIG_COMPILER_OPTIMIZATION_SIZE: y
      CONFIG_LWIP_MAX_SOCKETS: "16"
      CONFIG_MBEDTLS_HKDF_C: y
```

`CONFIG_COMPILER_OPTIMIZATION_SIZE` is not functionally required but assists with the size optimization since a full configuration will take a lot of space.

## 3. Components

Project is divided into two different components, `homekit_base` which handles the bridge logic and `homekit` that handles the actual accessory logic (lights, switches, etc.).

This repository also includes the `pn532` and `pn532_spi` components which are just slightly modified versions of the official ones from the ESPHome repository to suit HomeKey needs with no extra options added to them nor deleted, however, it's not guaranteed to be kept up to date with upstream changes.

There is also a `pn532_uart` component that can be used when the PN532 module needs to be connected via the HSU interface. However it is recomended to use the SPI interface whenever posible, as it is more reliable.

> [!TIP]
> For configuration examples, you can see the `.yaml` files in this repository, e.g. [lights-c3.yaml](lights-c3.yaml)

### 3.1. `homekit_base`

> [!NOTE]  
> The `homekit_base` component does not have to included in the configuration unless you are interested in one of the properties listed below as it is automatically loaded by the `homekit` component

#### 3.1.1. Configuration variables:

- **port** (Optional, int): The port HomeKit should listen to
- **meta** (Optional): Bridge information
  - **name** (Optional, string): Name of the bridge accessory
  - **model** (Optional, string): Model name for the bridge accessory
  - **manufacturer** (Optional, string): Manufacturer name for the bridge accessory
  - **serial_number** (Optional, string): Serial number for the bridge accessory
  - **fw_rev** (Optional, string): Firmware revision for the bridge accessory
- **setup_code** (Optional, string): The HomeKit setup code in the format `XXX-XX-XXX` - **Default:** `159-35-728`
- **setup_id** (Optional, string): The Setup ID that can be used to generate a pairing QR Code - **Default:** `ES32`

Configuration Example:

```yaml

homekit_base:
  meta:
    name: "PRIMO"
    manufacturer: "AMICI&CO"
    model: "IMPERIUM"
    serial_number: "16161616"
    fw_rev: "0.16.2"
  setup_code: '159-35-728'
  setup_id: "ES32"
```

#### 3.1.2. Factory reset

`homekit_base` can also be used as a platform component for the button component to reset the HomeKit pairings, see example below:

  ```yaml
  button:
  - platform: homekit_base
    factory_reset:
      name: "Reset HomeKit pairings"
  ```
This will function like any regular button in ESPHome and therefore will be visible in the Web Interface and HASS.

### 3.2. `homekit`

This is what handles the accessory logic like syncing states between HomeKit and ESPHome and basic information (name, attributes, etc.).

#### 3.2.1. Configuration variables:
- **light** (Optional): Array of Light entities

## 4. HomeKey

> [!NOTE]
> If you notice an error in the logs that says `Can't decode message length.`, you can safely ignore it. The project is using a "hijacked" version of the official pn532 component and the message is part of the normal operation of it since it's meant to be used with "regular" NFC Tags.

### 4.1 Disclaimer

> [!WARNING]
> The functionality of Homekey is entirely based on reverse engineering since HomeKit specs stopped being available to hobbyists and therefore the entire functionality or parts of it might or might not break in the future and/or lack official features or any internal implementations.

### 4.2 Setup

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Only PN532 over SPI(`pn532_spi` component) or the PN532 over HSU(`pn532_uart` component) are supported at the moment due to required modifications that haven't been ported to other protocols or chips

> [!NOTE]
> For quick reactions and to avoid issues, don't raise the `update_interval` over 500ms
> Esphome is turning of the RF side of the PN532 module whenever posible to avoid wifi interference. However this is causing problems with Homekey. You have to set the `keep_rf_on` option for reliable Homekey communication.

Example configuration for the SPI inteface:

```yaml
spi:
  clk_pin: 4
  miso_pin: 5
  mosi_pin: 6

pn532_spi:
  id: nfc_spi_module
  cs_pin: 7
  update_interval: 100ms
  keep_rf_on: true

homekit:
  lock:
    - id: <insert lock id>
      nfc_id: nfc_spi_module
```

Alternative example configuration for the HSU inteface:
```yaml
uart:
  id: uart_nfc
  tx_pin: 17
  rx_pin: 16
  baud_rate: 115200

pn532_spi:
  id: nfc_uart_module
  uart_id: uart_nfc
  update_interval: 100ms
  keep_rf_on: true

homekit:
  lock:
    - id: <insert lock id>
      nfc_id: nfc_uart_module
```
